Famous Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in what is now Smiljan, Croatia.
 Tesla's interest in electrical invention was likely spurred by his mother, Djuka Mandic, who invented small household appliances in her spare time while her son was growing up. 
Tesla's father, Milutin Tesla, was a priest.
 After studying in the 1870s at the Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the Johann-Rudolph-Glauber Realschule Karlstadt); the Polytechnic Institute in Graz, Austria; 
and the University of Prague, Tesla began preparing for a trip to America.

Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla was born in July of 1856,
 in what is now Croatia. He came to the United States in 1884, and briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. 
He sold several patent rights, including those to his alternating-current machinery, to George Westinghouse.
 His 1891 invention, the "Tesla coil," is still used in radio technology today. 
Tesla died in New York City on January 7, 1943.

Tesla came to the United States in 1884, and soon began working with famed inventor and business mogul Thomas Edison. The two worked together for a brief period before parting ways due to a conflicting business-scientific relationship, 
attributed by historians to their incredibly different personalities: 
While Edison was a power figure who focused on marketing and financial success, Tesla was a commercially out-of-tune and somewhat vulnerable, yet extremely pivotal inventor, who pioneered some of history's most important inventions. 
His inventions include the "Tesla coil," developed in 1891, and an alternating-current electrical system of generators, motors and transformersâ€”both of which are still used widely today.
